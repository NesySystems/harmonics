# Harmonics Project

The Harmonics Project is an exploratory codebase designed to map musical concepts onto a high-dimensional space, generate harmonic sound signals, and analyze them using Fourier transformations.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NesySystems/harmonics.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd harmonics
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the scripts:

```bash
python src/scale_mapping.py
python src/sound_generation.py
python src/fourier_transform.py
```

## Running the Tests
